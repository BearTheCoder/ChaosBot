# About

Hi, Hello.
ChaosBot is a project that I was invited to create by PhweedomStudios to be used in [her Discord server](https://discord.gg/xhtTHve64N).

Phwee was originally looking for a bot that could iterate over user's existing roles and assign a new role based on the roles the user already has.
After that was created, Phwee allowed me to have free roam in her server letting me create and use what I create in her 250+ people server.
As she stated: You get to play with the people in the Discord, I get the benefit of the fun you can bring.
So, this bot is just that, a fun project I come back to every now and then when I get a new idea.

This project is not meant for many Discord servers, but for one. That being said, the code is highly specilized for one server.
Feel free to use the code as reference, or if you want to get involved feel free to join the server and get to know everyone there!

The project is hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app) with future plans to be migrated to docker. (If i can take the time out to learn docker)

If you have any question or want to be involved, reach out to me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/DuMJjretE2).

Ok, bye.

# Issues and Excuses

-   Issue # 1 - Larry Bot and the no good very bad code.
      Larry, the sentient hygiene god of the server, has taken life in the form of a real-time response every time someone types "//larry".
      Sounds cool I'm sure, the issue?
      As you could probably tell "//larry" is not a "conventional" slash command that you might see on Discord.
      Instead, so Larry could be interactive and responsive, ChaosBot constantly looks through each message for "//larry"
      This causes optimization issues.
      
      This means ChaosBot fires everytime a message is sent in the Discord.
      
      This is not good code, and there is better ways to do this.
      But this was a decision between Phwee and I.
      The magic of Larry is his responsiveness and making him a slash command would have taken away some of the magic.
