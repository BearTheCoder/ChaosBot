# ChaosBot
 Discord bot used for testing inside of the Aethy and Phwee guild.
 

<h3>Important notes before continuing:</h3>
<li>The bot is hosted on Heroku.</li>
<li>aws-sdk is only needed inorder to use Heroku's built in variable system. If not using Heroku, aws-sdk can be uninstalled.</li>
<li>The gitIgnore generally would exclude node_modules, but for some reason Heroku requires node and aws_sdk to be included on GitHub. Hence why all 4,000 files were included.</li>
<li>If you are fimiliar with Discord and discord.js then you are aware of Slash Functions, when going through the code you may wonder why slash functions were not used. This option was considered and fully programmed in a seperate branch, but was ultimately disregarded as it lessened the experience using the bot.</li>
